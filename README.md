# Matchweek1---Arsenal-vs-Man-Utd-Prediction-Model
A 5-step pipeline in Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) → Feature Engineering → Model Training &amp; Validation → Final Win% Dashboard (Tkinter).

I built a 5-step pipeline — from data collection to final probability output — combining historical performance, player stats, head-to-head records, and form trends.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Tkinter for the dashboard.

The model runs through feature engineering, training, validation, and finally outputs a clean Win% breakdown.
